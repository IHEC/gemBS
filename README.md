gemBS
=====

gemBS is a high performance bioinformatic pipeline designed for highthroughput analysis
of DNA methylation data from whole genome bisulfites sequencing data
(WGBS). It combines GEM3, a high performance read aligner and
bs_call, a high performance variant and methyation caller, into a streamlined and efficient pipeline for
bisulfite sueqnce analysis.

The manuscript describing the pipeline is available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/11/201988)

Download
--------

Use ``git clone --recursive`` to retrieve the complete source code including the code from external projects such as ``bs_call`` and ``gem3-mapper``.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/IHEC/gemBS.git

------------
Installation
------------

1) Before starting the installation of gemBS, you will need to install
or check the installation of several packages.

  a) gcc with development libraries
  b) python3, pip3, matplotlib, multiprocess
  c) zlib, gsl, libncurses
  
If you are working on a clean (fairly recent) Ubuntu installation, you
can install everything required with the followiwg commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y python3 build-essential git python3-pip wget pigz
    sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev gsl-bin libgsl0-dev
    sudo apt-get install -y libncurses5-dev liblzma-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
    pip3 install matplotlib multiprocess

2) Download the gemBS distribution if you haven't already done so:

    ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/IHEC/gemBS.git``

3) Use python install command:

    ``python3 setup.py install --user``
